Because of my own eyes I fear I never will forget
Died in red, a memory of failure…our time I want to recur
Every single bit of love I had I don’t regret
While there’s still a lack of empathy, evil’s a friend to me
Since I still have ears I fear I’ll never smile again
As a voice calls out to me beyond the wall I can’t respond
Whisper, whisper, whisper, though desire never ends
There’s an evil breaking out its cage to finally rampage
Now I face a shadow with a mouth I have to bear
Every word I want to say I fear will never be okay
Whisper, whisper, whisper, though my heart is unaware
As I turn away from all my virtues, the mouth of evil renews
I might want a single night (night)
But without a fright (fright)
If I could only dream about the light (light)
Oh, come along with me, oh, if you want to see, oh, how to be free
These scars I want to hide them all away
To you I will convey, how I wish to betray your comfort now
Oh, come along with me, oh, if you want to see..

Since I still have ears I fear I’ll never smile again

Whisper, whisper, whisper, though desire never ends

Now I face a shadow with a mouth I have to bear
Every word I want to say I fear will never be okay
Whisper, whisper, whisper, though my heart is unaware
As I turn away from all my virtues, the mouth of evil renews
